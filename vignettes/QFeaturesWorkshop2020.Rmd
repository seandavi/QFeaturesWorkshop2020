## Introduction

**Learning Objectives** The goals of this workshop are to provide a
real-life example of step-by-step quantitative proteomics data
analysis using the `QFeatures` package.

Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics data can be
representated as a matrix of quantitative values for features (PSMs,
peptides, proteins) arranged along the rows, measured for a set of
samples, arranged along the columns. The is a common representation
for any quantitative data set. We will be using the
`SummarizedExperiment` class:
